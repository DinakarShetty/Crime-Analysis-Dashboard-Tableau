🚨 Crime Analysis Dashboard – Tableau Project
📊 Data-Driven Insights for Public Safety

This Tableau project explores crime data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between time, location, and arrest activity. The dashboard empowers analysts, policymakers, and law enforcement teams with actionable insights for smarter decision-making.

🧭 Project Overview

The Crime Analysis Dashboard is built entirely using Tableau.
It enables users to:

Understand types and frequencies of crimes.

Visualize time-based crime trends (by day, hour, and year).

Analyze arrest ratios and crime reduction patterns over time.

Compare crime categories to highlight key public safety challenges.

⚙️ Tools and Technologies
Tool	Purpose
Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public	Data visualization and dashboard design
MS Excel / CSV Dataset	Data cleaning and preparation
Calculated Fields (DAX / Tableau Formulas)	KPI & trend generation
Filters and Parameters	Interactivity and drill-down analysis
🗂️ Data Model
Field	Description
Case Number	Unique identifier for each crime
Primary Type	Category of the crime (e.g., Theft, Battery)
Description	Detailed crime report
Arrest	Boolean (True/False)
Location Block	Area where the crime occurred
Date & Time	Used to derive Year, Quarter, Month, Day, and Hour fields

Derived fields include:

Year, Quarter, Month, Day (Time analysis)

Hour (Hourly distribution)

Arrest Ratio = (Arrested Cases / Total Cases) × 100
