# 🚨 Crime Analysis Dashboard – Tableau Project  

### 📊 **Data-Driven Insights for Public Safety**

This Tableau project explores crime data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between time, location, and arrest activity. The dashboard empowers analysts, policymakers, and law enforcement teams with actionable insights for smarter decision-making.

## 🧭 Project Overview  

The **Crime Analysis Dashboard** is built entirely using **Tableau**.  
It enables users to:  
- Understand **types and frequencies of crimes**.  
- Visualize **time-based crime trends** (by day, hour, and year).  
- Analyze **arrest ratios** and **crime reduction patterns** over time.  
- Compare **crime categories** to highlight key public safety challenges.

## 🗂️ Data Model  

| Field | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Case Number | Unique identifier for each crime |
| Primary Type | Category of the crime (e.g., Theft, Battery) |
| Description | Detailed crime report |
| Arrest | Boolean (True/False) |
| Location Block | Area where the crime occurred |
| Date & Time | Used to derive Year, Quarter, Month, Day, and Hour fields |

Derived fields include:  
- **Year, Quarter, Month, Day** (Time analysis)  
- **Hour** (Hourly distribution)  
- **Arrest Ratio** = (Arrested Cases / Total Cases) × 100
